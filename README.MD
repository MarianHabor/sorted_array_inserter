This is a command-line interface (CLI) program designed to handle numbers within a sorted array. Here's how it works step by step:

User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a number. This is the initial interaction, where the user provides the data the program will work with.

Binary Search: Utilizing a binary search algorithm, the program determines the correct position within the sorted array where the user's number should be inserted. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until the possible location is narrowed down to just one.

Array Expansion: Once the insertion point is identified, the program increases the size of the array by one element. This is necessary because we're adding a new number to the array, and thus need space for it.

Element Shifting: To make room for the new number, the program shifts all elements that are to the right of the insertion point one position further to the right. This step ensures that the new element can be inserted without overwriting any existing elements.

Insertion: With space made, the program inserts the user's number into the previously determined correct position. This is done carefully to maintain the sorted (ascending) order of the array.

In summary, the program takes a number from the user, finds where it fits within a sorted array (keeping the array in ascending order), adjusts the array size, and shifts elements as necessary to insert the new number properly.
